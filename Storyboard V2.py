'''Goal: Write a short story using Python variables. The story will have 4 sentences and include certain characters, a place, something important, an action, and a goal.
How to do it:
Start your Python script by creating six variables. Each variable will hold a piece of information for your story:
main_character: The name of your main character.
secondary_character: The name of another character.
location: Where the story happens.
object: Something important in your story.
action: What your main character is doing.
destination: Where your main character is trying to go.
Set (assign) values to these variables. These values will shape your story.
Use string concatenation (joining strings together with a +) to create a story from these variables.
Your story should have four sentences. Each sentence should include at least one of your variables and make sense in the context of the story.
Print your final story so it shows up in the console.
Example: Here's how you might define your variables and print the story:
main_character = "Alice"
secondary_character = "the White Rabbit"
location = "the rabbit hole"
object = "a mysterious key"
action = "chasing"
destination = "a rabbit hole"
print(main_character + " began " + action + " " + secondary_character + " down " + destination)
What You Will Achieve: This task helps you understand how to use variables and string concatenation in Python. It's also a fun way to see how coding can be creative!
Remember:
Start your script with comments that include these instructions. Comments in Python start with #.  Also, explain what each part of the code is doing in your own words.
The provided code is an incomplete example. Create your own completely original, unique story made up of 4 sentences.
You must use concatenation (+)
Do not use input statements.  Assign values to the variables in the code.

#World building and actionable statements
m_character = "Lily"
s_character = "the mysterious old man"
action = "searching for"
object = "a glowing amulet full of magical energy"
destination = "the hidden cave deep within the enchanted forest."
location = "enchanted forest"

#Use this part as the story to assing values to the variables in the code. Remember to add spaces between "" so the words don't mix together.
sentence1 = m_character + " went into " + location + " with a sense of excitement. "
sentence2 = " Lily's goal was to find " + object + " that was said to be hidden in " + destination
sentence3 = " She was " + action + "clues left by " + s_character
sentence4 = " After searching for hours, Lily finally reached the entrance to " + destination

#This section is for printing the story 
print(sentence1)
print(sentence2)
print(sentence3)
print(sentence4)
